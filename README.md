# Sensing-Systems-for-Sustainability-Seagrass-pH
This was the final project for the Sensing Systems for Sustainability course.


The purpose of this research project was to create a sustainable sensing device to measure the light intensity, pH and temperature fluctuations in areas with and without seagrass to see if the presence of seagrass has a direct impact on pH. The fundamental research question addressed in this paper is, “Does the presence or absence of seagrass have an impact on the pH of the sea water?”. The following hypotheses were tested.
Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference between the pH fluctuations in the selected areas with seagrass compared to the areas without seagrass.
Alternative Hypothesis: There will be a greater fluctuation of pH in the selected area with seagrass compared to the areas without seagrass.
The goals of this project are to test and calibrate all necessary sensors and create a sensing system to be deployed. The intention behind this device is to alleviate the need for researchers to physically collect water samples every hour, thus saving time and money. Unfortunately, although the sensors were able to measure the necessary data, the device did not store the collected data for analysis. This issue was mainly caused due to the pressure of water and instability of the cables and has been thorouhgly discussed in the report. The device has been created using an Arduino, a temperature sensor, a light sensor, a pH sensor, and further these devices were soldered on a PCB board.
